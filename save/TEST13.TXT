I don't want this moment to ever end where everything is nothing without you. i wait here forever just to to see you smile cause it's true i'm nothing without you. through it all i made my mistakes a stumble and falls but i mean this word i want you to know with everything i won't let you go this words are my heart and soul. i hold on to this moment you know cause i bleed my heart out to show and i won't let go
