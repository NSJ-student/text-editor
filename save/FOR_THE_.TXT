For The First Time In Forever - Frozen OST

The window is open so is that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we own 8 thausant salad flats.

For years i ~~ this empty door.
Why have a bowl room with no bowl?
Finally they openning up the gates.

There will be actual real live people
It will be totally crazy
Wow am i so ready for this change.

For the first time in forever
There will be magic there will be light

For the first time in forever
I'll be notice by someone

And i know It's totally crazy to dream i find romance
But for the first time in forever i won't be alone

"I can't wait to meet everyone. What if i meet 'The One'?"

Tonight Imagine in ~~~~. 

I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger tall and ~~~
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening which is totally ~~
nothing~~~



~~~

Don't let them in 
Don't let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, Don't feel
Put on a show make one wrong move and everyone will know
But it's only for today
It's agony to wait
Tell the guards to open up the gate

The gate~~~

For the first time in forever
